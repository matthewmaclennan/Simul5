Workflow

Simul5 Complex needs to take snapshots of the separation

Autoit:
1. export *.csv file
2. Continue run
3. Repeat step 1.

R 
1. Line up the csv snapshots into a matrix (can same image() of matrix to bitmap or jpeg)
2. Compute the 1st and 2nd derivatives to find break points between fronts and plateaus for determining peak shapes
3. Compute the centre of mass for peaks and regress on their capillary position as a function of time.
4. Obtain capillary motion equation; obtain peak shape change equation; obtain all equations for a run
